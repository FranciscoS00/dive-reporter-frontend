                            The main goal of the app is to engage local Dive Centers and Dive Operators to use the app by integrating a query in the post-dive debriefing of SCUBA divers and report sightings of target species/taxa. The application allows the dive guides to preselect the number of divers, dive time and the selected dive spot, as to quantify sampling effort. After each dive, the dive guide asks diving participants to report sightings and abundance of the selected species by first selecting the species of desire, and then selecting the number indicating the abundance. The same process can be made for other species and is repeated by asking the whole group to agree on the consensus. Once all species are checked, the report is created and automatically updated to our servers at <a href="https://wave-labs.org/" target="__blank">Wave Labs</a>/<a href="https://mare-madeira.pt/" target="__blank">MARE-Madeira</a>.
